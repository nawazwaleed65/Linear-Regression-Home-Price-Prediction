Description:
This repository contains a Python implementation of Linear Regression with one variable to predict home prices based on the square feet area. 
The example focuses on a real-world dataset from Monroe Township, New Jersey, and demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: Processes input data from CSV and visualizes it using scatter plots.

Model Implementation: Demonstrates a simple implementation of Linear Regression using Python and libraries like NumPy.

Error Analysis: Includes Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculation to evaluate model performance.

Visualization: Provides scatter plots and fitted line visualizations for better understanding.

Modular Design: Organized into reusable Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for exploration.

Saved Models: Stores model weights for easy reuse.

Dependencies:

Python (>=3.8)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook (optional)
